Version 1.0.0-16
* Check to make sure that any test function names that were provided (as opposed
  to discovered) actually exist in the test script.
  
Version 1.0.0-15
* Add the ability to specify test function names in a variable (jshuTestFunctions)
  that will be run before the discovered functions (those whose names end with Test).
  See the test/addhocFunctionNamesTest.sh script or the sample/incrbuild_unitTest.sh
  script for an example of use.
  
Version 1.0.0-14
* Add two possible return values for a test - ${jshuFAILABORT} and
  ${jshuERRORABORT}. These allow you to mark failures and errors in a test
  that are so severe that the rest of the tests in the test suite should not
  be run.
Version 1.0.0-13
* Modify calling of jshuSetup and jshuTeardown functions so that if they fail 
  for some reason, the failure will be caught and reported.
  
Version 1.0.0-12
* Prevent test result writing from erroring out when you call a test script
  from a test script - as long as you are in a bash shell - because only the bash
  shell provides a means of getting a subshell pid.

Version 1.0.0-11
* Bring back build 9 and then protect against missing capture file.

Version 1.0.0-10
* bad release - reverts back to 1.0.0-5

Version 1.0.0-9
* Filter binary (unprintable) characters out of the CDATA stdout capture to
  prevent malformed XML.
  
Version 1.0.0-8
* Fix problem of malformed xml when a jshu_errmsg string has an embedded quote mark. 
  Convert it to html entity &quot; .

Version 1.0.0-7
* Add support for skipped test messages now that I know Jenkins can display them.
  Simply assign your skip message to jshu_errmsg before the ${jshuTEST_SKIP}.

Version 1.0.0-6
* Change directory back to where the test script was started from before executing
  each test function.
* Miscellaneous code cleanup and commenting.
