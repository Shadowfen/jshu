Version 1.0.0-20
* Add tests duration in tests reports
* Use the results/xunit path for XML results
* Refactor XML with timestamps, failures, hostname
* Return error level in finish steps
* Use 'Tests.*' naming for XML result files
* Always adapt the package name to a file name
* Improve tests outputs with colors and spacing
* Trim extended and colored chars from execution outputs
* Extract jshu_errmsg and test_title from the output
* Handle errors inside test functions and verbose output
* Implement optional "test_title" variable in test
* Support passing a formatted tests suite name
* Apply shfmt formatting Bash codestyle to all files

Version 1.0.0-19
* Removed testcase property (assertions) that Jenkins no longer supports.
* Limited elapsed time to 3 decimals because the Jenkins time validation is now broken.

Version 1.0.0-18
* Fixed up function ordering errors and a dangling quote.

Version 1.0.0-17
* Patches submitted by ireicht to fix issues with file paths that have embedded spaces and to fix a segfault in the sample/incrbuild_unitTest.sh
* Modification to the patched sample/incrbuild_unitTest.sh to change the name ofa "dynamic" test function so that it will not also be a "discovered" test function (so the test will not run twice).

Version 1.0.0-16
* Check to make sure that any test function names that were provided (as opposed
  to discovered) actually exist in the test script.
  
Version 1.0.0-15
* Add the ability to specify test function names in a variable (jshuTestFunctions)
  that will be run before the discovered functions (those whose names end with Test).
  See the test/addhocFunctionNamesTest.sh script or the sample/incrbuild_unitTest.sh
  script for an example of use.
  
Version 1.0.0-14
* Add two possible return values for a test - ${jshuFAILABORT} and
  ${jshuERRORABORT}. These allow you to mark failures and errors in a test
  that are so severe that the rest of the tests in the test suite should not
  be run.
Version 1.0.0-13
* Modify calling of jshuSetup and jshuTeardown functions so that if they fail 
  for some reason, the failure will be caught and reported.
  
Version 1.0.0-12
* Prevent test result writing from erroring out when you call a test script
  from a test script - as long as you are in a bash shell - because only the bash
  shell provides a means of getting a subshell pid.

Version 1.0.0-11
* Bring back build 9 and then protect against missing capture file.

Version 1.0.0-10
* bad release - reverts back to 1.0.0-5

Version 1.0.0-9
* Filter binary (unprintable) characters out of the CDATA stdout capture to
  prevent malformed XML.
  
Version 1.0.0-8
* Fix problem of malformed xml when a jshu_errmsg string has an embedded quote mark. 
  Convert it to html entity &quot; .

Version 1.0.0-7
* Add support for skipped test messages now that I know Jenkins can display them.
  Simply assign your skip message to jshu_errmsg before the ${jshuTEST_SKIP}.

Version 1.0.0-6
* Change directory back to where the test script was started from before executing
  each test function.
* Miscellaneous code cleanup and commenting.
